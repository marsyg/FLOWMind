# 🌊 MindFlow: AI-Powered Personalized Routines - Your Day, Perfectly Orchestrated! 🌊

Hey there, productivity pal! 👋 Welcome to the README for **MindFlow**, your AI-powered companion for crafting the perfect daily flow! 🌈

## 🎯 What's the Flow?

Struggling to find the perfect routine? 😩 Not all productivity methods work for everyone. We get it! MindFlow is here to bring calm to the chaos. 🧘‍♀️ We're building an app that understands *you* – your goals, your personality, and even those non-negotiable moments in your day – to create a personalized routine that actually works. 🤩

## 🧠 Why MindFlow?

**Not all productivity methods work for everyone.** MindFlow creates personalized daily routines based on your MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), energy levels, and goals, ensuring your schedule aligns with how you work best.

**What is MBTI?** 🤔 MBTI is a personality framework that helps identify how you process information, make decisions, and interact with the world. Some people thrive on structure, while others prefer flexibility. By integrating MBTI, MindFlow tailors schedules to your natural work style.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack: The Magic Behind the Flow

We're using some seriously cool tech to make MindFlow happen:

* **💻 Frontend:** Next.js – For a smooth, responsive, and delightful user experience.
* **🛡️ Backend:** Prisma ORM – To keep our database interactions type-safe and efficient.
* **💾 Database:** PrismaDB – To securely store and manage your precious data.
* **✍️ Language:** TypeScript – For type safety, scalability, and maintainability.
